CONTEXT
Campus Reality
Jamia Hamdard faces recurring student issues including:

Poor water and food hygiene in hostels

Faulty water coolers across academic blocks

Poor Wi-Fi connectivity

AC failures in classrooms and hostels

Timetable clashes and classroom allocation issues

Delayed academic results

These issues often affect many students simultaneously but are reported individually and inconsistently.

Current Reporting State

No digital grievance portal

Students physically approach offices (provost, admin office, academic staff)

No aggregation of complaints

No prioritization based on impact or frequency

Why Automation Is Required
At Jamia Hamdard’s scale, manual triage fails because:

Staff cannot infer impact from single complaints

Frequency patterns are invisible

Infrastructure issues escalate only after prolonged disruption

Campus Pulse automates:

Issue understanding

Multi-student impact detection

Priority escalation

Department routing suggestions

Environmental Context
Environmental and infrastructure issues (water leakage, sanitation, electricity misuse) directly affect campus sustainability and student well-being. The system focuses on on-campus issues only. Off-campus settlement problems are explicitly out of scope.

Branding
The system is branded as “Campus Pulse” and customized for Jamia Hamdard using real campus locations.
