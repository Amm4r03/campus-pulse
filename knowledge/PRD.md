Project Name
Campus Pulse – Smart Issue Triage & Automation Portal for Jamia Hamdard

Institution Context
Jamia Hamdard is a single, large, integrated campus with approximately 5,000–6,000 students. The campus includes academic departments, gender-segregated on-campus hostels, canteens, a hospital, sports complex, and common facilities. All student issue reporting is currently offline and fragmented.

Objective
Build a centralized, web-based system that automates the triage, aggregation, prioritization, and routing of student-reported issues across Jamia Hamdard, enabling administrators to act on high-impact, multi-student, and infrastructure-related problems faster.

Problem Being Solved
Currently:

No centralized grievance portal exists

Students must physically visit offices to report issues

Repetitive complaints go unnoticed as patterns

Infrastructure and environmental issues escalate late

Administrative response is reactive, not prioritized

Campus Pulse introduces automated decision support that surfaces urgency, frequency, and impact before human action.

Goals

Centralize all student issue reporting across departments and hostels

Automatically aggregate similar complaints into single high-impact issues

Dynamically prioritize issues based on urgency and reporting frequency

Route issues to correct Jamia Hamdard authorities

Improve accountability and response transparency

Non-Goals

No automated resolutions

No chatbot-based grievance handling

No off-campus civic issue handling

No predictive analytics beyond current reports

Target Users

Students of Jamia Hamdard

Provosts and hostel authorities

Academic administration

Administrative office (infrastructure)

Security and sanitation teams

Success Criteria (Prototype)

Admin panel shows aggregated issues with frequency metrics

Priority ordering updates automatically as reports increase

Real Jamia Hamdard locations are selectable in reports

Admins can override automated priorities
